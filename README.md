### How to use it
1. Run `support_assistant.py` in your Python environment.  
2. Interact with the assistant in the terminal.  
3. Type `exit` to end the chat.


### How it works
- The assistant is built using **Azure OpenAI’s Responses API**.  
- It supports **multi-turn conversations**: you can ask multiple questions, and the assistant will remember the last few messages.  
- Conversation is managed explicitly using a `messages` list, where each user and assistant message is stored.  
- To prevent long chats from using too many tokens or slowing down responses, it uses a sliding window to keep only the last 6 messages in memory (plus the system prompt).


### Guardrails & Rules
1. Always responds in a calm, polite, and professional tone.  
2. Remains polite and neutral if the user is angry or uses abusive language.  
3. Does not answer questions about sensitive credentials (passwords, credit cards, SSNs, etc.).  
4. Redirects requests for legal or financial advice to the company phone contact.  
5. Filters certain sensitive keywords before calling the API to avoid unnecessary processing and cost.


### Cost & Usage Management
- Maximum **tokens per API request**: 200  
- Maximum **user input length**: 1000 characters  
- **Sliding window** keeps the last 6 messages, automatically dropping older messages to manage context efficiently.
  

### Limitations
- No real backend or database. All responses are generated by the AI.  
- No external knowledge retrieval (RAG).  
- Responses may sometimes include made-up product details for demonstration purposes.
  

### Visuals
The assistant uses the **Rich library** for nicer terminal output with panels and colored text.
